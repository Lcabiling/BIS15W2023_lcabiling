## Instructions
Answer the following questions in RMarkdown. Please embed all of your code and push your final work to your repository. Be sure to add your name to the author header above.



## Questions

1. Look up 'Data Scientist' at https://www.bls.gov/. What degree is required for this career? Is it a growing occupation?  
  Data Scientists require at least a bachelor's degree, with some jobs require a masters or doctorate degrees. The occupation is projected to grow 36% from 2021 to 2031. 

2. How would you describe your data science skills on a resume for a job application? Write a blurb that reflects the skills you have learned in this course. 
Coding Skills: R Programming Language
  - Proficiency with data modeling and analysis using R. 
  - Ability to sort and clean through raw data sets. 
  - Format and create maps and graphs from previously cleaned datasets and raw data sets

3. What are your current career interests, and how could your R skills support that career path? (hint: this might be good content for your LinkedIn profile ;)
  My current career interests lie with water management or conservation management, it is extremely important to have proficiency in R. Pursuing a career in water and/or conservation management may deal with sorting and cleaning through large data sets that were collected by other scientists out in the field. Using the data, I have the ability to make several types of graphs, maps, and statsitical analyses.

4. What about this course has been the most difficult for you? What has been the most rewarding?
  The most difficult part of this course was the memorization aspect, I understand I can easily look back at the labs to remind myself what I should do, but it can massively disrupt my train of thought or flow of work. Additionally, the hardest lab for me was the graphing aspects as it was partly on memorizing what graphs go best with what types of data. However, finally being able to get the code to work properly with or without issues, was the most rewarding part of the course. 

5. What do you wish you had known, or what skills do you wish you had, before taking this class.
  I wish I remembered more about the basics of R from my PLS 21 course. I also wish I had a better knowledge of using computers in general in order to be able to troubleshoot certain issues I had. 

6. If we had 1 more lab in this class, what would you have liked to learn more about?
  I would have liked to learn more about mapping along with the statistics portion of data analysis as I think that would be an important aspect in my future career. 

7. Now that you have (almost!) completed this course, do you plan to persue further data or computer science skills? What do you plan to do?
  I do plan to persue further data or computer skills, specifically by taking online data analysist courses online to get a certification as I am graduating in the spring. 

8. How important was working with a partner to your success in this class? If this class were transitioned to an online format, how do you think that would affect your understanding?
  It was very important to work with a partner in this class, I was able to talk out problems I was having with a code and having them look it over. I think this class could be taken online, but the only issue would be if a student does not have good access to internet to run a video call and the R program. Furthermore, the issue would lie with seeing both the video call screen and the R program at the same time as the screen can potentially not be big enough. 

9. Did you complete the class evaluation? Please complete the class evaluation using the link provided in the announcements. Your feedback is very important and we appreciate your time.
  YES I DID, Thank you for all the help :)
